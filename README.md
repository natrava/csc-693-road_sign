## Introduction
* General information:
   * With the help of Portenta H7 camera we have collected the image data of 8 road signs and then developed a model to classify the images
   * We then used the images taken from Portenta to tarin the Convolution Nueral Network model
   * Later we Pruned and Quantized the model to reduce the size of the model
   * We then created the TFlite file and is then deployed into the micro controller
   * The .py file which is used in the deployment has been placed in the **src** path

## Project Aim
* Goals of this project:
   * To develop a model that can predict different road signs accurately
   * Deploy and run the model on the portenta micro controller and detect the road sign

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python 3

## Setup
* To run this project
    * the code for the project can be found in the **src** folder
    * the code for the project is written inside jupyter notebooks
    * all code can be run by using the *run* button in jupyter notebooks
* Project reports and presentations can be located in the **docs** folder
* data can be found in the **data** folder
    * contains images taken using portenta H7 in the project
